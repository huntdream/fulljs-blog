# react-express-blog

I am going to build a blog with React for front-end and Express for backend.

Everything will be implemented by JavaScript.

I have no systematical outline about this app

Just go forward step by step!

(I think I have to change the repo's name)

## Backend

The Express backend will be a RESTful server providing the
the basic CRUD manipulation

* [ ] User Login Auth
* [ ] RESTful features

## Front-End

Tech stack: React, react-router, redux
UI: material design and custom style
